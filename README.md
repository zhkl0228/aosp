Getting started
---------------

To get started with Android, you'll need to get familiar with [Source Control Tools](https://source.android.com/setup/develop).

To initialize your local repository using the aosp trees, use a command like this:
```
repo init -u git://github.com/zhkl0228/aosp.git -b android-12.0.0_r32
```
Then to sync up:
```
repo sync
```
